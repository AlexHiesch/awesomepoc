## Manifesto
Only include actual awesome stuff in this list. Keep in mind, it's a curation, not a collection.
But what is awesome?
Only stuff you can personally recommend. Rather leave things out than include too much.
For the greatest impact, we welcome your participation, sharing and spreading the word about this list.
